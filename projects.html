                        <h4 class="view-text-7">Through some in depth organization, I was able to develop a chart with all items as well as prompts that would lead to: obtaining the items, directional cues, and blocked passages that would prevent the player from progressing. The process became much quicker and simpler, and allowed me to focus most of my time on the story.</h4>

                        <h4 class="view-text-7">The simplicity of this app is definitely something that reminds me of the classic text-adventure games I would play growing up.

                        <h4 class="view-text-7">As the only developer of this app, I was responsible for all aspects of this game. While a lot of my time went into the actual coding of this game, I also wanted to make sure this app had an atmospheric element to it. </h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-6">Project Difficulties</h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-7">The most difficult part of this app was probably the paddle of the game. It was difficult to create a smooth movement to the paddle whenever the player moved from one side to another.</h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-6">My Solution</h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-7">To fix the issue with the paddle, I used the constrain feature to limit the overall speed and make it so that the paddle does not move too quickly. I also did this with the ball in order for it to not move too quickly.</h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-6">Notable Features</h4>
                        <h4 class="view-text-7">The audio in this app is probably my favorite part as it really feels as if you are in space.</h4>
